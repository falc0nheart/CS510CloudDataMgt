These steps should guide you upon setting up the DataStax Java Driver 
to work successfully with Eclipse.

1. Install Eclipse (used: KEPLER SR2)
2. We need to install Maven within Eclipse
	- Go to Help > Eclipse Marketplace
	- Search for 'maven'
	- Install Maven 0.11 (by Nodeclipse)
	- Restart IDE
3. Create new Maven Project (need group-id and artifact-id, chosen: cass-driver2)
4. Edit 'pom.xml' to include:

<dependency>
  	  <groupId>com.datastax.cassandra</groupId>
  	  <artifactId>cassandra-driver-core</artifactId>
 	  <version>2.0.1</version>
</dependency>
	
This should be placed within the <dependencies> element, under the junit. (Already in GIT)

5. Upon insertion, you should be able to Run As Java Application.*

* Errors:

Consistently receive the following errors:
SLF4J: Failed to load class "org.slf4j.impl.StaticLoggerBinder".
SLF4J: Defaulting to no-operation (NOP) logger implementation
SLF4J: See http://www.slf4j.org/codes.html#StaticLoggerBinder for further details.

They do not affect the Cassandra Driver portion, as those are called regardless. I am
still troubleshooting the root cause of this.
